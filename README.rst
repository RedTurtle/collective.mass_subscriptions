Introduction
============

Subscribe a set of users taking from a CSV file all required data.

Detail
------

With this product you can import in your Plone site a full set of users, providing a CSV
file with all required and optional data. If your user's fieldset is customized you can also
provide non-standards ones.

The only required column is *username*. The *password* data, if not provided, will be
generated randomly.

If you have powers to manage groups, you can also add all new users to one or more groups
available.

If you add a row named 'group', the user is added to that group.


Finally you can send a notification message to those users, customizing the message text
(for example: to give to users the account's email address).
